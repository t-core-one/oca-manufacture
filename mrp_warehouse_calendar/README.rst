This module ensures that manufacturing orders created from procurements
respect the calendar assigned to the warehouse associated with the
manufacturing order's picking type. The planned start date of the
manufacturing order is calculated based on the product's manufacturing
lead time and the working schedules defined in the warehouse calendar.

Additionally, any manual rescheduling of the start or end date of a
manufacturing order will also take the lead time into account, following
the working days defined by the warehouse calendar.

Usage
=====

When a manufacturing order is created out of a procurement evaluation
(from an orderpoint, MTO,...) the calendar is considered in the
computation of the planned start date of the manufacturing order.

For example, if it takes 1 day to manufacture a product and it is
required for Monday: |Replenish|

the manufacturing order will be created with planned start date on the
previous Friday, if the warehouse operates under a Mo-Fri working
calendar. |Manufacturing Order|

Manual changes to the start or end date of a manufacturing order will
also respect the lead time and the warehouse calendar's working days.
