Allow to propagate a package from a component to a finished product.

This is useful for instance if you want to keep the box of one of the component
(which could have already a label stuck on it) for your finished product.

Two constraints:

* the component quantity has to be 1 unit
* the manufacturing order has to produce exactly the BoM quantity

This is to ensure we get only one package reserved for the given component.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
